# Implementation Plan: Camera Distance Calculator

## üìã Executive Summary

This plan outlines the implementation of a TypeScript function `computeMaxDistance` that calculates the maximum horizontal ground distance from a camera's mounting point to the furthest painted line, ensuring a minimum pixel separation between consecutive lines.

## üéØ Project Goals

1. **Primary Objective**: Implement a mathematically correct solution that finds the optimal camera tilt angle to maximize viewing distance
2. **Core Constraint**: Maintain minimum vertical pixel separation between consecutive ground lines
3. **Deliverables**: 
   - TypeScript function with clear implementation
   - Comprehensive test suite with 80%+ coverage
   - Mathematical derivation documentation

## üîç Clarification Questions

Before proceeding with implementation, let's ensure complete alignment:

### 1. Mathematical & Physical Assumptions

**Q1.1**: The PRD states "Camera may pitch freely (no limits)" - Should we consider practical physical constraints (e.g., -90¬∞ to +90¬∞) or truly allow unlimited pitch angles?

**Q1.2**: For the pinhole camera model, should we account for any lens distortion effects at extreme zoom levels, or maintain the ideal pinhole assumption throughout?

**Q1.3**: When computing line projections, should we consider the line's physical width (even if infinitesimal) or treat them as mathematical lines with zero thickness?

### 2. Edge Cases & Boundary Conditions

**Q2.1**: When `minPixelGap` exceeds sensor height (1440px), the expected behavior is D=0. Should the function throw an error/warning or silently return 0?

**Q2.2**: If the optimal tilt angle results in some lines projecting outside the sensor bounds, should we:
   - a) Only count lines fully visible within the sensor?
   - b) Count partially visible lines?
   - c) Adjust tilt to ensure all counted lines are fully visible?

**Q2.3**: For numerical precision, what tolerance should we use for:
   - Pixel gap comparisons (e.g., is 9.999px acceptable for minPixelGap=10)?
   - Angle calculations (degrees to radians conversions)?

### 3. Implementation Details

**Q3.1**: For the optimization algorithm to find optimal tilt Œ∏:
   - Should we use analytical solution (if derivable)?
   - Binary search with specified precision?
   - Golden section search?
   - What convergence criteria/tolerance?

**Q3.2**: Should the function validate input parameters (e.g., zoomLevel ‚àà [1,25], minPixelGap > 0)?
   - Return specific error types?
   - Use assertions?
   - Silent clamping?

**Q3.3**: For internal calculations, should we:
   - Work in radians throughout and convert only for display?
   - Maintain any intermediate results for debugging/logging?

### 4. Testing & Validation

**Q4.1**: The PRD mentions "Round-trip projection" tests. Should these tests:
   - Use the same numerical precision as the implementation?
   - Allow for floating-point comparison tolerance?
   - Test with random values or specific edge cases?

**Q4.2**: For property-based testing (monotonicity), should we:
   - Test all integer zoom levels 1-25?
   - Include fractional zoom levels?
   - Test specific pixel gap ranges?

**Q4.3**: Should test fixtures include:
   - Visual debugging output (e.g., ASCII art of projections)?
   - Performance benchmarks?
   - Numerical stability tests?

### 5. Code Organization & Documentation

**Q5.1**: Should the implementation be:
   - Single file with all helpers inline?
   - Modular with separate files for math utilities?
   - Include visualization/debugging utilities?

**Q5.2**: For the analytical derivation documentation:
   - Inline as extensive comments?
   - Separate markdown file with LaTeX formulas?
   - Both inline summary + detailed external doc?

**Q5.3**: Should we provide:
   - Usage examples beyond the two mentioned?
   - Performance characteristics documentation?
   - Numerical limitations/precision notes?

## üìê Technical Analysis

### Understanding the Problem

1. **Camera Setup**:
   - Fixed height: 20m
   - Variable focal length: f = min(4.8 √ó zoomLevel, 120) mm
   - Sensor: 2560√ó1440 px
   - Can only adjust pitch (tilt) angle

2. **Ground Lines**:
   - Parallel lines every 2m
   - Line 0 directly below camera
   - Lines extend infinitely in both directions

3. **Optimization Goal**:
   - Find tilt angle Œ∏ that maximizes distance D
   - Constraint: vertical pixel gap between consecutive lines ‚â• minPixelGap

### Key Mathematical Relationships

1. **Sensor Dimensions** (derived from FOV at f=4.8mm):
   ```typescript
   SENSOR_WIDTH  = 2 √ó 4.8 √ó tan(55¬∞/2) ‚âà 5.506 mm
   SENSOR_HEIGHT = 2 √ó 4.8 √ó tan(33¬∞/2) ‚âà 3.209 mm
   ```

2. **Projection Formula** (ground point to image):
   - Ground point at distance d ‚Üí image y-coordinate
   - Depends on: focal length f, tilt angle Œ∏, camera height h

3. **Pixel Gap Calculation**:
   - Gap between lines N and N-1 in pixels
   - Must derive closed-form expression Œîy(d, f, Œ∏)

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Mathematical Foundation
1. Derive projection equations
2. Express pixel gap as function of parameters
3. Find optimal tilt angle (analytical or numerical)

2. Optimization algorithm for tilt angle
3. Distance calculation from optimal configuration

### Phase 3: Testing Suite
1. Boundary condition tests (as specified)
2. Property-based tests (monotonicity, consistency)
3. Round-trip validation tests
4. Coverage verification (‚â•80%)

### Phase 4: Documentation & Polish
1. Inline documentation with derivations
2. Usage examples and edge cases
3. Performance characteristics

## üìä Success Criteria

1. **Correctness**: All tests pass, including edge cases
2. **Coverage**: Minimum 80% code coverage
3. **Performance**: Function executes in < 10ms for typical inputs
4. **Clarity**: Code is self-documenting with clear variable names
5. **Maintainability**: Modular design allowing easy updates

## üöÄ Next Steps

Once all clarification questions are answered:

1. Create test file with failing tests (TDD approach)
2. Implement mathematical derivation
3. Code the core algorithm
4. Iterate until all tests pass
5. Refactor for clarity and performance
6. Document thoroughly
7. Validate with comprehensive test suite

## üìù Notes for Implementation

- Follow CLAUDE.md guidelines strictly (NO MOCKS!)
- Use real mathematical computations throughout
- Maintain high code coverage from the start
- Commit after each passing test (red-green-refactor)
- Run `pnpm run validate` before final commit
