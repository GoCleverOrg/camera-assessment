I shared the table of results with another thinking model (o3-pro):
```
| Zoom Level | Maximum Distance (m) |
| ---------- | -------------------- |
| 1          | 100                  |
| 2          | 138                  |
| 3          | 170                  |
| 4          | 196                  |
| 5          | 198                  |
| 6          | 198                  |
| 7          | 198                  |
| 8          | 198                  |
| 9          | 198                  |
| 10         | 198                  |
| 11         | 198                  |
| 12         | 198                  |
| 13         | 198                  |
| 14         | 198                  |
| 15         | 198                  |
| 16         | 198                  |
| 17         | 198                  |
| 18         | 198                  |
| 19         | 198                  |
| 20         | 198                  |
| 21         | 198                  |
| 22         | 198                  |
| 23         | 198                  |
| 24         | 198                  |
| 25         | 198                  |
```

And I ask it: "Please explain me these results and if you think the program outputs consistent results."

Here is its answer:

## 1 What the numbers are telling you

| Zoom Level | f (mm)\* | Vertical FOV (°)\*\* | Reported D (m) | Equivalent strips N = D / 2 |
| ---------: | -------: | -------------------: | -------------: | --------------------------: |
|          1 |      4.8 |                 33.0 |            100 |                   50 strips |
|          2 |      9.6 |                 16.7 |            138 |                          69 |
|          3 |     14.4 |                 11.1 |            170 |                          85 |
|          4 |     19.2 |                  8.2 |            196 |                          98 |
| **5 – 25** | 24 – 120 |            6.8 → 1.3 |        **198** |                      **99** |


* Assuming the code maps zoomLevel linearly to focal‑length:
f = 4.8 mm × zoomLevel, clamped at 120 mm.
** Computed from the inferred 2.84 mm sensor height.

### Why D should keep growing
* H = 20 m is the mounting height,
* f is the focal length (increases with zoom),
* vFOV (f) shrinks as f grows,
* θ is the tilt that you are free to choose.

Simultaneously the pixel gap between two consecutive strips at distances `d` and `𝑑−2` m is, to first order,
`Δy(f,d)≈ (2fH) / (d(d−2)p)`, with `p` the pixel pitch (≈ 2 µm). Because Δy∝f, larger focal lengths make the “10‑px rule” progressively easier to satisfy, letting you tilt the camera closer to the horizon and push the bottom‑ray distance `𝐷geom` far out.
At f=120 mm the physically achievable D is on the order of 400–500 m, not 198 m.

## 2 Why your output plateaus at 198 m
The jump from 196 m (zoom 4) to 198 m for every zoom ≥ 5 strongly suggests an artificial cap in the implementation, most likely:
* a loop that stops after 99 strip intervals (<= 100 iterations), or
* a hard upper bound such as
```
while (N < 100 && pixelGap >= minGap) { … }
```

Once the loop hits `N = 99`, the function returns `D=99×2=198` m no matter how much zoom or focal length you give it, producing the flat line you see.

## 3 Are the results “consistent”?

* Internally consistent? Yes: the numbers are monotonic and never shrink when zoom increases.
* Physically consistent? No. Beyond zoom ≈ 5 the real geometry would continue to increase D significantly; the plateau reveals a coding or algorithmic ceiling, not a physical one.


## 4 Recommended sanity checks
Add unit or property‑based tests that would have flagged this early:

1. Unbounded‑zoom growth
```
expect(computeMaxDistance(10, 10))
  .toBeLessThan(computeMaxDistance(25, 10));   // should be TRUE
```

2. Strip‑count search limit
Call the internal routine with an intentionally tiny minPixelGap (e.g. 1 px).
If you still get 198 m you know the search simply stops at N = 99 regardless of the gap.

3. Analytic back‑check
Compute the theoretical pixel gap at f=120 mm and d=198 m: Δy≈ (2fH) / (d(d−2)p) ≈ (2⋅0.12⋅20) / (198⋅196⋅1.97×10^-6 ) ≈ 62 px.
That completely overshoots the 10‑px requirement, proving the algorithm stopped early.


## 5 How to fix / improve
1. Remove artificial iteration caps—search until the first failure of the 10‑px condition or until the bottom ray exceeds horizontal `(θ−vFOV/2≤0)`.
2. Provide a mathematical closed form for the optimal tilt and D (no iterative line‑by‑line scan needed).
3. Add the tests above so future regressions are caught automatically.

Once you lift the cap, you should see D climb well past 198 m for zoom levels above 5, reflecting the true telephoto reach of the camera geometry.

---

I want you to assess, analyze and digest this assessment of o3-pro model and list (without any implementation):
* All the things you agree with the critique
* All the tests that we can apply to the existing code so that we proove / disproove what the o3-pro model assessment says.
* Provide a complete prompt with all the relevant code and tests that I'll copy and past to o3-pro.

Here are the replies from the o3-pro:

## 1  Is the hard cap at 200 m the sole cause of the 198 m plateau?

Yes.
The binary‑search upper bound

```ts
let right = 200;   // <-- artificial ceiling
```

means the algorithm will **never** test any distance ≥ 200 m.
Because you round each probe to the nearest multiple of `LINE_SPACING = 2 m`

```ts
const distance = Math.floor(mid / LINE_SPACING) * LINE_SPACING;
```

the best value the search can possibly return is

$$
\text{bestDistance} = 200\text{ m} - 2\text{ m} = 198\text{ m},
$$

exactly what you observe for every zoom level ≥ 4. Nothing else in the code limits the distance.

## 2  What is the theoretical maximum distance if the cap is removed?

Using the camera geometry

| Symbol           | Value                      | Explanation                                     |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| $H$              | 20 m                       | camera height                                   |
| $f_{\text{max}}$ | 120 mm                     | at zoom 25                                      |
| $s_y$            | 2.84 mm                    | sensor height, inferred from 33° vFOV at 4.8 mm |
| $p$              | $s_y / 1440 = 1.98 µm$     | pixel pitch                                     |
| $v\text{FOV}(f)$ | $2\arctan\!\frac{s_y}{2f}$ | vertical field of view                          |

and the optimal‑tilt rule “place the furthest visible strip on the bottom edge”, the analytic condition for the limiting distance **D\* (zoom)** at the 10‑px threshold is

$$
\frac{f}{p}\,
\Bigl[\tan\bigl(\arctan\!\tfrac{H}{d-2}-\arctan\!\tfrac{H}{d}\bigr)\Bigr]
\;=\;10.
$$

Solving this numerically (or in closed form with small‑angle approximations) gives the following monotonic curve:

| Zoom | Focal Length (mm) | Max Distance D\* (m) |
| ---: | ----------------: | -------------------: |
|    1 |               4.8 |                  100 |
|    2 |               9.6 |                  140 |
|    3 |              14.4 |                  170 |
|    4 |              19.2 |                  196 |
|    5 |               24  |                  220 |
|   10 |               48  |                  312 |
|   15 |               72  |                  382 |
|   20 |               96  |                  440 |
|   25 |               120 |            **≈ 492** |

Hence, with zoom 25 the camera can still resolve a ≥ 10‑pixel gap between the last two strips almost **half a kilometre away**.

---

## 3  Pixel gap at 198 m, zoom 25

With $f=120$ mm and $d=198$ m:

$$
\Delta y_{\text{pixels}}
  \;=\;\frac{f}{p}\Bigl[\tan\!\bigl(\phi_{d-2}-\theta\bigr)
                       -\tan\!\bigl(\phi_{d}-\theta\bigr)\Bigr]
  \;\approx\;62\text{ px},
$$

where

* $\phi_{d}   = \arctan(H/d)$
* $\theta     = \arctan(H/d) - \tfrac{v\text{FOV}}{2}$.

So the algorithm is **using only 16 % of the available resolution** at telephoto: the last two strips are six times farther apart than required.

---

## 4  Is simply removing the 200 m limit sufficient?

Removing that cap (or replacing it with an adaptive bound) is the **essential fix**.
Suggested replacement:

```ts
let left  = LINE_SPACING;
let right = 10000;                // large first guess
// or, better: double `right` until pixelGap < minPixelGap
```

Other considerations and best practices:

| Issue                   | Recommendation                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Loop termination**    | Continue expanding `right` until `findOptimalTiltAngle(...)` returns `null` (pixel gap < minGap). This avoids guessing an upper bound.                                              |
| **Performance**         | The binary search is $O(\log D)$; even with `right = 5000` it converges in \~13 iterations—negligible.                                                                              |
| **Numerical precision** | When D gets large, $\arctan(H/D)$ is small; use double precision and guard against catastrophic cancellation.                                                                       |
| **Unit tests**          | Add checks such as `expect(computeMaxDistance(25,10)).toBeGreaterThan(400)` and property‑based tests to guarantee monotonicity (D increases with zoom, decreases with minPixelGap). |

With these changes the program’s outputs will match the theoretical curve above and the plateau will disappear.

### Quick sanity table (after the fix, minPixelGap = 10 px)

| Zoom | Expected D (m) | Pixel Gap at D (px) |
| ---: | -------------: | ------------------: |
|    4 |            196 |                  10 |
|    5 |            220 |                  10 |
|   10 |            312 |                  10 |
|   25 |            492 |                  10 |

These values continuously increase—as physics, not the previous loop limit, dictates.

Please @PLAN.md the fix including a way to validate everything was properly implmented (I want to be sure you didn't introduce mathematical/logical bugs or that you interduced artifical caps like the one you introduced).

@PLAN.md I want you to improve the the existing cli flag to support receiving the the zooms as a rage, e.g. 1-5 (meaning zoom 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). For those cases, data should be presented in a table format and if the image flag is provided, multiple images should be generated (sufixing the zoom level to the name of the image).


@PLAN.md I want you to improve the existing system so that zoom parameter becomes an optimal parameter. If it's not provided the camera should find the min zoom level that satisfies its goal for example if you run the actual system with multiple zoom levels (1 decimal place) you'll notice that for a gap of 10px the zoom min zoom level that maximizes the distance is `4.1`. All the numbers bellow that number, do not provide such a longer distance, all the numbers above that number, do not provide improve the distance. Also it's important that the Camaera Analysis Results in the cli (and the function) return not only the docal length but also the zoom level that was used to achieve the distance (if zoom is provided that value should be returned).

@PLAN.md I want you to write a proper README so that an AI Agent and a human know how to use this tool. It should be a markdown file easy to read and understand docused in the available cli API and all the supported use cases.
