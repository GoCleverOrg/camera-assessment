@PLAN.md the generated image is "upside down". Lines should be farther away in the bootom of the image instead of the top. Im the context of this issue I would also like you to think in a way we can generate a proper prompt to validate the physicality of the image implementation with o3-pro model. Please use git history to search the implementation plan related to the image generation inside the scripts folder so that you can understand the requirements, and write a proper prompt that I can copy and past to o3-pro model so that it does a proper code revision/assessment and validates if the implementation is sound and grounded on physics.




Are you able to create a new gh repo in the gocleverorg organization in my account (using `gh` terminal commands) and associate this repo to that gh repo? When you do that please check if you need to update any existing project documentation, eg. @README.md




We have markers defined as a constant every 2m. We want to @PLAN.md plan making this an optional cli parameter (default 2m), just like we did with @scripts/camera-height-parameter-plan.md
